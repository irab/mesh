                        <h3>Meshtastic Routing Architecture</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Meshtastic utilizes a hybrid routing approach consisting of three main components:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Flooding Router</strong>: The base routing layer that implements simple flood-based message propagation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Next Hop Router</strong>: Extends the flooding router with packet acknowledgment and retransmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reliable Router</strong>: Adds additional reliability mechanisms for messages that require acknowledgments.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Flooding Mechanism</h4>
                        <p>When a node receives a packet:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It checks if it has seen this packet before (using a duplicate detection table)</li>
                            <li>If new, it decrements the hop limit and, if not zero, rebroadcasts the packet</li>
                            <li>All nodes in a channel rebroadcast messages regardless of the destination</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Packet Retransmission Logic</h4>
                        <p>Meshtastic implements retransmission for reliability:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intermediate nodes perform up to 2 retransmissions</li>
                            <li>Original senders perform up to 3 retransmissions for reliable messages</li>
                            <li>Packets are stored in a pending retransmission queue until acknowledgment or timeout</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Congestion Control</h4>
                        <p>Meshtastic scales intervals based on network congestion:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Router/repeater nodes don't have their intervals scaled</li>
                            <li>Tracker/sensor nodes get priority for position and telemetry</li>
                            <li>Regular nodes scale back transmission as the network grows</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="card-header meshcore">
                        <h3>MeshCore Routing Architecture</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>MeshCore employs a more selective routing approach with distinct routing modes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Flood Routing</strong>: Similar to Meshtastic but with priority-based retransmission</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct Routing</strong>: Path-specific routing with selective forwarding</li>
                            <li><strong>Zero-Hop Routing</strong>: For local broadcast without retransmission</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Selective Packet Forwarding</h4>
                        <p>MeshCore only forwards packets if they match specific criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only forwards direct-routed packets if this node is the next hop</li>
                            <li>Does not retransmit packets it has seen before</li>
                            <li>Removes its hash from the path before rebroadcasting direct packets</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Priority-Based Transmission</h4>
                        <p>MeshCore uses a priority system for transmissions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Direct messages get highest priority (0)</li>
                            <li>Regular messages get medium priority (1)</li>
                            <li>Path discovery packets get lower priority (2)</li>
                            <li>Advertisements get lowest priority (3)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Congestion Mitigation</h4>
                        <p>MeshCore employs several congestion mitigation techniques:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Airtime Budget</strong>: Nodes limit to approximately 33% airtime utilization</li>
                            <li><strong>Randomized Delays</strong>: Prevents collision storms after regional events</li>
                            <li><strong>Path-Based Priority</strong>: Messages closer to source get higher priority</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Broadcast Storm Risk</h4>
                        <p>With 50,000 active users, Meshtastic's flood-based routing would create significant congestion:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each message potentially propagates to every node within hop limits</li>
                            <li>With default settings, congestion scaling would help but might not be sufficient</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Resource Utilization</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Packet pool size is limited and could be quickly exhausted</li>
                            <li>Under heavy load, oldest packets would be dropped from queues</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Role-based prioritization helps critical nodes like ROUTER maintain function</li>
                            <li>Less effective at discarding unnecessary retransmissions</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Significantly reduces network-wide traffic compared to flooding</li>

                            <li>Nodes would need to be positioned within 1-2km of each other for reliable coverage</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Broadcast Efficiency</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High redundancy ensures messages reach destinations if any path exists</li>
                            <li>At 50K users sending messages, network would likely experience significant congestion</li>
                            <li>Congestion scaling would increase intervals between broadcast messages</li>

            <h2>Technical Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In a large-scale disaster scenario with 50,000 users across 1,000 nodes in 300 km²:</p>
            <p><strong>Meshtastic</strong> would provide more immediate message propagation through its aggressive flooding mechanism, but would likely suffer from significant congestion and packet loss. It would perform best in the immediate aftermath when node count is lower and redundancy is critical.</p>
            <p><strong>MeshCore</strong> would offer more sustainable communication over time through its selective routing and prioritization schemes. While initial path discovery might take longer, the network would maintain higher throughput once paths are established, especially with strategic room server placement.</p>
            <p>For maximum resilience, a hybrid deployment could leverage Meshtastic's flooding for critical emergency messages and MeshCore's selective routing for sustained communication channels.</p>
